# Lyrics

(Verse 1)
Yo, check the code, it's Pythonic and free,<br>
No .exe baggage, just scripts running clean.<br>
GitHub's the platform, my lines flow like streams,<br>
Building the future, one module, one dream.<br>

(Chorus)
Click, clack, the code, a symphony bright,<br>
No need to compile, just logic taking flight.<br>
From data to apps, the possibilities swell,<br>
Python's the language, where innovation dwells.<br>

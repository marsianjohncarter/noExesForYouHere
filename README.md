# Lyrics

(Verse 1)
Yo, check the code, it's Pythonic and free,\n
No .exe baggage, just scripts running clean.\n
GitHub's the platform, my lines flow like streams,\n
Building the future, one module, one dream.\n

(Chorus)
Click, clack, the code, a symphony bright,\n
No need to compile, just logic taking flight.\n
From data to apps, the possibilities swell,\n
Python's the language, where innovation dwells.\n
